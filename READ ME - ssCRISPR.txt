ssCRISPR was created by Austin Rottinghaus.

ssCRISPR can be used to design gRNAs with strain-specific cleavage profiles.

Download the application and ensure that the ssCRISPR file is in the same locations as the following documents:
1. Cas_icon3.ico
2. finalized_model_cpf1.sav
3. finalized_model_cas9.sav
4. All_NCBI_Strains.xlsx

When you run the program, you will be prompted to input the following criteria for gRNA design:
1. Your email address - Note: This is only used to request genome sequences from NCBI. You won't recieve any emails.
2. Whether you are using Cas9, Cpf1, or another Cas protein
3. PAM sequence in A, T, C, and G nucleotides - The program does not accept multi-nucleotide letters, such as R, S, and N.
4. The desired number of nucleotides of specificity
5. Target sequence length
6. PAM orientation
7. List of target strains
8. List of non-target strains

User-provided FASTA files can be used as target and non-target strains.

If you want to update the ALL_NCBI_Strains.xlsx file to include the most recent catalogue of sequences,
the table can be downloaded from https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/browse#!/prokaryotes/.
Be sure to filter by bacteria and complete genomes. Reorder the excel sheet in the same way as the one provided.
The organism name and strain name can be combined into a new column using =IF(ISNUMBER(SEARCH(B2,A2)),A2,A2&" "&B2) in cell C2.
Drag the formula for all organisms and strains.
